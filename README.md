# Welcome to the Agfa HealthCare Waterloo Java interview exercise

Before the interview, please perform the following steps:

1. Clone this git repository onto your machine
2. Ensure you have Java installed (we've tested with Java 11 and 17)
3. If you need to, you can compile the project from the command line by navigating to the location where you cloned the project and running: 

	```.\gradlew.bat build``` (on Windows)
	
	```./gradlew build``` (on Mac or Linux)

	NOTE: if you are on Mac or Linux and this command doesn't work you may need to give 'execute' to the file with ```chmod 0755 gradlew```

4. Open this project in your favourite Java capable IDE. (We've tested with IntelliJ and VSCode with the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) installed)
5. Make sure you can successfully run the test in `GoodToGoTest.java`
6. Feel free to look at the starter code that you see (but don't edit it yet)
7. Be prepared to screen share your IDE over Teams.
